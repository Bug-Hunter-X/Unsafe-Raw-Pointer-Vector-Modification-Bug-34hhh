This repository demonstrates a common error when working with raw pointers and vectors in Rust.  The `bug.rs` file shows code that modifies a vector through a raw pointer without proper handling of the vector's internal data structures, which may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version, emphasizing safer alternatives for vector manipulation.
